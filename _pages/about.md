Rong-Yu Gu is a Ph.D. student in Gentine's lab in Earth and Environmental Engineering, Columbia University. She is studying the phenological responses of vegetation to climate and natual disturbances using multi-scale observations and machine learning-driven products. Her research interest includes terrestrial carbon cycle, climate extremes, eco-hydro-climatology, land-atmosphere interactions.



Prior to attending Columbia University, she received her B.S. in 2018 and M.S. in 2020 in Atmospheric Sciences from National Taiwan University, Taiwan. Her previous work pointed out the role of canopy wetness in regulating air temperature in a montane cloud forest in Taiwan.
